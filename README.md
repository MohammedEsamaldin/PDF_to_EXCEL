# PDF_to_EXCEL


 This project is a tool to convert PDF files that contain tables into Excel files.
 Used libraries:
 - Tabula
 - Tkinter
 - Pandas



 The process of using this app is :
  -  A window with a button "Convert PDF to Excel" will appear.
  -  Clicking the button will open a file dialog where you can select the PDF file you want to convert.
  -  After selecting the file, the script will convert the PDF to Excel and save the Excel file in the same directory as the PDF with the same name (but with a .xlsx extension).
  -  A message box will then appear, informing you of the success of the conversion and the path where the Excel file was saved.
